I am a lecturer in statistics. I obtained my PhD from Newcastle University, School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics in March 2020. I had a master in statistics from Mosul University, College of Mathematics and Computer sciences in 2006. In addition, I had a Bachelor in statistics form Mosul University, College of Mathematics and Computer Sciences in 2002.

My Research interest in the area of Bayesian statistics and focus on Bayes linear methods and Bayesian networks. My thesis's title is "Bayes linear Bayes network models for medical diagnosis and prognosis".

I have published two papers in journals in statistics. I am planning to publish a paper with my supervisor Dr. Malcolm Farrow in the journal of Bayesian analysis.

I have a basic knowledge in programming languages such as S-Plus, R and Octave. I have done most of my research work using R during my study.

I am an experienced and enthusiastic statistician and I teach Maths as well.
