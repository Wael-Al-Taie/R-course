In addition, I had a Bachelor in statistics form Mosul University, College of Mathematics and Computer Sciences in 2002.

My Research interest in the area of Bayesian statistics and focus on Bayes linear methods and Bayesian networks. My thesis has the title "Bayes linear Bayes network models for medical diagnosis and prognosis".

I have published two papers in journals in statistics. I am planning to publish a paper with my supervisor Dr. Malcolm Farrow in the journal of Bayesian analysis.

I have a bit knowledge in programming languages such as S-Plus, R and Octave. I have done most of my research work using R during my study.
